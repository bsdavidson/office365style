# Office 365 Style
CSS that can be used in Stylish or Stylebot to make the Office 365 webapp easier to read at a glance.  

# How to use
Login to your Office 365 Account. 
Open the CSS file, copy everything, and paste it into the CSS editor window of Stylish, Stylebot, or some other plugin that supports inserting your own css.  

Feel free to edit to your own taste.  I tried to make it as close to Microsofts colors as possible.  Let me know if there is something that isn't styled.  Microsoft has a lot of interesting classes that seemed to switch names for bizarre reasons breaking the style.
